Original text of post to www.pbxtech.info that I used to configure the definity

Here is how I got CDR billing sent via TCP/IP to my Linux host:

Definity:

(add an entry for your billing linux host)
CHANGE NODE-NAMES IP
LINUX-HOST 192.168.0.50

(point your box which host and port it should send billing)
CHANGE IP-SERVICES
CDR1 C-LAN LINUX-HOST 50000

(tell your box how to generate CDR there)
CHANGE SYSTEM-PARAMETERS CDR
(page-1)
Primary Output Format: customized
Primary Output Endpoint: CDR1
